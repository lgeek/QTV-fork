(upcoming) Version 0.3:
TODO:
# bugfix: user selection in the list gets lost during an update which could lead to wrong entries in the queue
# bugfix: unicode mostly sucks because it's splitted and can't be rejoined at the moment
# bugfix: program can't be closed while it's updating
# update: include a "remove from the list" button in the queue
# bugfix: isohunt.com sometimes comes up with wrong stuff (e.g. 10 things i hate ... => greys anatomy)
# update: add torrentz.com; seems to be a good site with verified results
# update: activate/deactivate google-calendar stuff, choose which calendar should be used, how many days before the air-date should a calendar entry be created?
# update: prevent trying to search for a torrent for an episode which hasn't aired
DONE:
# update: detailsView displays further episode details (summary, cast, trivia, ..)
# update: create a direct link to the tv.com article
# update: integrate google calendar
# update: autoLoader days should be configurable in the settings
# update: the current 3 autoLoader torrent-sites should be checkable in the settings
# update: implement http://isohunt.com/ because it's also very up-to-date
# update: autoLoader should search for Good() when torrent hasn't been verified
# bugfix: showsToday prints stuff which comes from the rememberView icons -> icons are not printed now
# update: autoLoader uses btjunkie now and checks torrents for community-validation
# update: work on the settings UI (use tabs!)
# update: add a checkbox in the settings which sets an autostart of the program under Linux & Windows
# bugfix: resize of showView doesn't work perfect under different window-managers (workaround in rememberview.cpp)
# update: added an autostart option in the settings-dialog
# update: add toolTips to the icons in showView
# bugfix: showview give a wrong minimumSizeHint if no icons are used => now minimumSizeHint check icons for validity
# update: include "serienjunkies.org" as alternative to the torrent-search for rapidshare loaders
# update: create an auto-torrent-downloader which loads the torrent and opens it with the system-standard-program (http://www.fulldls.com/ is up-to-date)
# update: parse the "next" and "previous" episodes of top-tv-shows
# update: improve the shown info with air-location, genre, and probably similar shows
# update: search for alternative images if they don't exist on the next-episodes.net site
# update: implement an information-loader which gathers show-summaries from the web (files, offline!)
# update: read the "top-tv-shows" to populate the list with popular shows which aren't played currently (e.g.: simpsons in summer)
# update: implement an image-loader and show a image of the selected show in the details-tab
# update: the UI includes now a new button to download a .torrent-file and a button which leads the user to a website with more info about the show (e.g. tv.com)
# update: removed the seconds-spinBox in the settings (who needed it anyways?)
# update: the name of the episode is shown in a tool tip
# update: the parser tries to make characters uppercase after some special characters (e.g. space)
# update: the reminder-list gets cleared every day => like a daily restart

Version 0.22
# update: first release of a 64bit binary for Linux
# update: closing from the sysTray closes the program for shure (even when the mainWindow isn't hidden)
            (it was only minimized when the mainWindow wasn't hidden before)
# update: the reminder got 2 extra functions (choosable from settings-dialog):
            1) SysTrayMessage: remind the user as long (every update!) until he clicks the message
            2) ReminderWidget: because the trayMessages could be prohibited an extra widget is created
# update: In my opinion the captions looked ugly. removed most of them (queue didn't even had one..)
# update: grouped all the options in the settings-dialog (e.g. proxy was grouped already)
# bugfix: The first "parse" command blocked the constructor; fixed it with a timer
            (this was necessary to make the closing-stuff work!)
